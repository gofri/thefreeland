# Head-Counting Solutions for Retail Stores in Israel

## Overview:
Retail people counting (head-counting) systems measure how many customers enter, exit, and occupy a store or shopping area. In Israel, retailers can choose from camera-based solutions with advanced software, sensor-based counters, and hybrid systems. Many solutions offer cloud-based analytics dashboards (with real-time data accessible via the internet) as well as on-premise setups for local data control. Beyond basic footfall counts, modern systems provide insights like heatmaps of shopper movement, dwell time (how long customers spend in areas), queue lengths, and even demographic breakdowns (age and gender) using AI. Below, we detail the key products and service providers available in Israel, including their features, benefits, limitations, pricing (where known), and suitability for various retail environments.

## Camera-Based People Counting Solutions

Camera-based counters use overhead cameras (often dual-lens 3D cameras or AI-enabled CCTV cameras) to track people moving in and out. They tend to be highly accurate (often 95–99% in ideal conditions) and can differentiate individuals even in groups or busy crowds. These systems often provide rich analytics because the video feed allows AI algorithms to measure more than just entry counts. Benefits: High accuracy, ability to gather additional data (paths, zones visited, demographics). Limitations: Higher cost than simple sensors, require proper mounting (usually on the ceiling), and need lighting or IR for dark conditions. Privacy can be a concern, but most solutions anonymize data (e.g., processing images on-device and not storing video). Below are camera-based solutions popular in Israel:

**FootfallCam (via SysCount)**: FootfallCam is a UK-based leader in 3D stereoscopic people counters, represented in Israel by SysCount Ltd.. The flagship FootfallCam 3D Pro2™ uses twin lenses to create a depth map for counting, achieving high accuracy by detecting human height and shape. It counts bi-directionally (entries/exits) and can exclude children or objects by height. FootfallCam systems offer cloud-based analytics (FootfallCam Cloud V9) with over 60 report templates. They track metrics like total visits, unique visitors (using WiFi/Bluetooth pings), repeat visit rate, and dwell time. Add-ons include in-store tracking (the FootfallCam Centroid device) to generate heatmaps of shopper movement and journey analytics. SysCount provides local installation, support, and integration services in Israel. Use cases: Deployed in malls and chain stores globally (e.g., Walmart and others) and in Israel for retail chains and shopping centers. Pricing: FootfallCam advertises entry-level systems *"starting from USD $300"* for basic setups, though a full mall installation package with multiple counters is around $3,300–$9,500 (including hardware and software). In practice, a single FootfallCam 3D device costs on the order of ~$800–$1200 each (exact pricing varies by reseller and volume). Annual software fees may apply for cloud services (FootfallCam includes the first year of their professional analytics in purchase).

**V-Count**: V-Count is a global company (originating in Turkey) offering AI-powered stereo vision counters. They have local representation in Israel (e.g., through HyperTech). V-Count's latest devices include the V-Count Nano and Ultima series (Ultima AI, Ultima GO, etc.) which all use dual-lens 3D imaging. These sensors boast ~98–99% counting accuracy in real-world deployments. V-Count systems provide a rich cloud analytics platform. Standard features include real-time occupancy monitoring, group counting (identifying groups vs single visitors), child vs adult differentiation, and staff exclusion to avoid counting employees. V-Count is notable for additional analytics modules: gender and age recognition (with the Ultima AI device), queue management (monitoring lines and wait times), zone-based heatmaps for tracking movement in store zones, and even WiFi-based repeat visitor tracking – using anonymous phone signals to detect return customers. All data funnels into dashboards that can compare traffic by time, location, and even trigger alerts when occupancy limits are reached. Use cases: V-Count is used by large international retailers and malls (clients include IKEA, Samsung, Sephora, etc. ). In Israel, it is suitable for shopping malls, supermarkets, museums, and retail chains that need a scalable, centralized solution. Deployment: The system is typically cloud-based (data from sensors goes to V-Count's cloud for analysis), but it supports on-premise data viewing as well. Pricing: V-Count pricing is quote-based. The hardware cost per sensor is likely in the same range as similar 3D cameras (several hundred dollars each). V-Count offers packages or subscriptions depending on the number of sensors and analytics features (for example, a full solution includes hardware plus a SaaS fee for the analytics dashboard).

**CountRite Technologies**: CountRite is an Israeli company (est. 2004) specializing in advanced counting solutions. They provide end-to-end people counting systems for retail chains, shopping malls, and other venues. CountRite's solution uses an overhead sensor network (camera-based with proprietary algorithms) to detect people's movements and count entries/exits. The system provides real-time data on the current number of visitors on site, entries and exits per door, people by floor, and even counts by defined areas (e.g., a store's departments or mall zones). Managers can use this data to optimize staffing and even control building systems (like HVAC or lighting) based on occupancy. CountRite offers a unified dashboard for reports (e.g. comparing traffic between different days, locations, etc.) and can integrate the footfall data with other business systems – in Israel they integrate with platforms like Gazit/Verifon, Comax, and Priority, which are common retail POS/ERP systems. Use cases: CountRite tailors solutions for malls (they list Israeli mall operators like Azrieli and Ofer as clients), retail store chains, museums, night clubs, and even smart city applications. The versatility (including outdoor pedestrian counting and even bicycle counters) is a highlight. Features: In addition to basic counting, they provide occupancy monitoring, queue management (to alert on long queues), and audience analysis. Because CountRite is a local provider, they offer hands-on consulting, custom reports, and local support through all stages (implementation to ongoing operation). Pricing: Custom – as a solutions provider, CountRite typically offers a project-based quote depending on the scope (number of sensors, locations, integrations). They emphasize ROI through saving time and money via improved operations rather than low upfront cost, so their solutions are likely comparable in cost to other high-end camera systems.

**RetailNext**: RetailNext is a prominent international in-store analytics provider that has been expanding through acquisitions (including a UK footfall specialist from Ipsos). RetailNext offers a comprehensive platform combining overhead video counters, Wi-Fi tracking, and even POS data integration to analyze the full customer journey. Their proprietary IoT sensor (e.g., the RetailNext Aurora sensor) uses video and integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth to count visitors with high precision and track dwell times. RetailNext's software is cloud-based and known for powerful analytics and reporting used by global retail brands. Availability in Israel: While RetailNext doesn't have a local Israeli office, Israeli retailers can work with RetailNext directly or through regional partners. For example, global brands operating in Israel (flagship stores, luxury retail, etc.) might deploy RetailNext for unified analytics across countries. Features: Besides people counting, RetailNext provides heatmaps, path tracking, queue analysis, and even shopper demographics through video analytics. Pricing: Premium – typically involves hardware purchase or lease and an ongoing subscription. It's generally aimed at enterprise retail clients.

**Hikvision / Dahua People Counting Cameras**: Many retailers in Israel leverage solutions from major CCTV manufacturers like Hikvision and Dahua, often installed by local security integrators (e.g., iSeeYou for Dahua). These companies produce special dual-lens people counting cameras (for example, Hikvision's DS-2CD6825G0/C-IS dual-lens camera) that are mounted overhead at entrances. They use deep learning algorithms on the camera to count entries and exits with high accuracy, even distinguishing adults from objects or carts. Dahua's people-counting cameras similarly provide bi-directional counts and can feed data into their video management software. According to an Israeli integrator, the largest people counting deployment in Israel (for the Naaman/Vardinon store chain) is based on Dahua's system. Benefits: These camera-based solutions are often cost-effective if a store already has CCTV infrastructure – the counter cameras can integrate with existing NVRs or management software. They typically display real-time occupancy and can generate basic reports. Limitations: They may not have the advanced multi-store analytics or extra features (like demographic analysis) out of the box that dedicated solutions (FootfallCam, V-Count) offer, unless combined with additional analytics software. Use cases: Suitable for small to medium retailers who want a reliable entry count and occupancy info, or large chains that can integrate camera counts into a centralized system. Pricing: A dual-lens people counting camera from Hikvision or Dahua costs a few hundred dollars (roughly $300–$600 per camera, model dependent). Software is often included (e.g., Hikvision's free iVMS or Dahua's DSS can collect the data) – making it a lower-cost alternative for basic needs. However, adding analytics beyond counting might require an upgraded VMS or third-party software.

**Axis and Other Smart Cameras**: Axis Communications (Swedish camera maker) and some other vendors offer people-counting analytics apps that run on security cameras. For instance, Axis has an ACAP plugin for people counting, and third-party companies (like Camlytics or Imron etc.) provide software that works with video streams. In Israel, these are typically delivered via system integrators in the security sector. They can be an option for retailers who already use those camera systems. Features and accuracy vary, but generally they handle counting and occupancy; advanced analytics might need coupling with analytic platforms.

## Sensor-Based and Alternative Counting Technologies

Not all counting systems rely on standard cameras. There are several other technologies used for people counting in retail, each with their own advantages. These include infrared beam sensors, thermal imaging counters, radar-based sensors, and even Wi-Fi-based tracking. Many providers actually combine these with camera systems for a multi-layer solution. Below we explore these alternatives:

**Infrared Beam Counters**: These are the simplest form of people counters. An IR beam device typically has a transmitter and receiver placed across a doorway, counting a "tick" each time the invisible beam is broken. Some models use dual-beams to infer direction (in vs out) by the sequence of breaks. Benefits: Very affordable (some units cost only a few hundred shekels/dollars) and easy to install (often battery-powered and wireless). They work for small entrances and give a basic count of visits. Limitations: Accuracy is limited – if two people walk in together, they might be counted as one break or not at all if side by side. They can't distinguish children vs adults, nor filter carts or staff. There are no analytics beyond the count number (though some systems can store hourly counts or connect to a simple software to pull data). Use cases: Small boutiques, single-door shops, or internal aisle counting where cost is a concern and only basic footfall is needed. Examples: Storetraffic's PEARL wireless people counter is a popular IR beam device (battery-operated, wireless data). Many other off-the-shelf models (e.g., on Amazon) exist. These solutions are available in Israel through local security suppliers or online import. Pricing typically ranges from ~$200 to $500 per doorway.

**Thermal Imaging Sensors**: These use infrared thermal cameras to detect the heat signatures of people. A well-known manufacturer is Irisys (InfraRed Integrated Systems). Their sensors (like the Irisys Vector series) mount overhead and sense the heat of human heads/bodies passing below. By tracking moving heat blobs, they count entries and exits. Benefits: Thermal counters work in low light or even dark conditions (since body heat is detected), and they preserve privacy (no identifiable video is used). Accuracy is high (older models achieved >95% accuracy, and newer models claim near 100% with AI calibration). They can also cover wide entrances by stitching multiple sensors. Limitations: Thermal devices generally can't provide demographic info or detailed behaviors – they detect presence and motion but not features like gender or age. Also, very closely packed crowds can sometimes confuse thermal images. Use cases: Common in supermarkets and malls for counting shoppers at entrances. For example, some large grocery chains have used thermal people counters for years to track store traffic and staff scheduling. In Israel, thermal counters might be offered via integrators focusing on energy management or smart building (since the technology overlaps with HVAC optimization by measuring occupants). Examples: Irisys Vector 4D is an advanced sensor that even adds AI to improve counting in crowds and can do basic dwell time. Other brands include FLIR which makes thermal imaging cores used in people counting. Pricing: These tend to cost similar to camera systems (several hundred dollars per sensor) and usually come with software or interfaces to integrate data.

**Radar-Based Counters (Imaging Radar)**: A cutting-edge approach uses millimeter-wave radar sensors to count and even track people. Israeli company Vayyar leads in this space with its 4D imaging radar technology. Vayyar's retail sensor units emit radio waves and interpret the reflections to detect human presence and movement in the store – effectively "mapping" people's positions in real time without any cameras. Benefits: Radar is completely privacy-safe (no optical image, and individuals can't be identified), and it can cover areas beyond just doorways. For example, Vayyar's solution can count how many people are in different zones of a store, monitor how they move (paths), where they dwell, and even detect if they pick up products (by monitoring shelf stock changes and movements nearby). It works in all lighting conditions. Limitations: This is a newer technology, and while promising, it's less common in deployments than camera or IR sensors. The accuracy for counting entries needs careful calibration (to distinguish someone entering vs just moving near the entrance, for instance). Also, radar sensors have a limited range and resolution – a single device might cover a certain square footage, so multiple units may be needed for large spaces. Use cases: High-value retail scenarios or innovative projects – for example, a store that wants to test advanced shopper analytics with complete anonymity, or a mall that wants to avoid installing cameras. It's also useful in scenarios where camera installation is difficult (very low light, or outdoors in harsh conditions) since radar isn't affected by light. Examples: Vayyar Retail solution provides real-time alerts and analytics – counting at entry, queue monitoring at checkout, heatmapping "live and dead zones," and dwell times, all via radar. Other radar-based people counters include some smart building sensors (mmWave sensors used for occupancy in offices), but Vayyar's system is specifically tuned for retail analytics. Pricing: Not publicly disclosed; as a high-tech solution, expect costs per sensor similar to high-end cameras or more. It likely involves a solution package with sensors and software services.

**Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Tracking Systems**: Another technology for footfall analytics uses the signals from smartphones. Systems like Cisco Meraki CMX or retail analytics platforms (like the former Euclid, or Walkbase) can detect Wi-Fi pings from smartphones as visitors come into range. By counting the number of unique devices, they estimate foot traffic and can measure dwell time (time a device stays in range) and return frequency (device seen again on another day). Benefits: No additional hardware needed beyond Wi-Fi access points or small BLE beacons; it can cover a broad area (anywhere within the radio range, not just at the doorway). It excels at dwell time and loyalty metrics – for example, seeing that 30% of visitors were repeats or that average visit duration was 20 minutes. Limitations: It's an indirect measure – not everyone has a smartphone on, and some people carry multiple devices. Also, due to privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.), these systems typically hash or anonymize the data and might not catch every signal (many phones randomize their MAC addresses now to avoid tracking). Thus, Wi-Fi counting is usually used to identify trends rather than exact visitor counts. It might undercount actual people or have bias (e.g., teens with no phones won't be counted, or one person with two devices might be double-counted if not filtered). Use cases: Mall operators often use Wi-Fi analytics to understand footfall patterns through corridors and shops, and to measure marketing events (seeing if more people came and stayed longer). Retail chains might use it to gauge store "stickiness" or the ratio of passersby to entrants (if a device is detected outside vs inside). Examples: Some Israeli malls and stores have used Cisco's wireless infrastructure for this kind of analysis. Also, solutions like Ariadne (a platform mentioned for heatmaps and flow using smartphone data) are available. Often, Wi-Fi tracking is combined with camera counters: the camera gives the accurate count, while Wi-Fi gives extra insight on repeat visits and dwell. Pricing: If the infrastructure exists (Wi-Fi APs), the cost is mainly the software subscription for analytics. Many enterprise Wi-Fi systems include a basic version of this for free, with advanced analytics as a licensed add-on.

**Other Sensors**: There are niche technologies like pressure-sensitive mats (placed under floor at entrances to count footsteps – mostly obsolete due to maintenance issues), laser scanners (some use LIDAR-like laser line sweep to detect people crossing a threshold), and ultrasonic sensors (using sound waves to detect echoes from people passing through a doorway). These are less common in retail now, having been largely superseded by camera and thermal methods which are more accurate. However, they might appear in specific cases. For example, laser counters can be very precise in controlled conditions (they might be used in theme parks or outdoor pedestrian counting). Bluetooth beacons can be used to actively count known customers (if they have an app that detects in-store beacons), but that's more for personalized marketing than general counting.

### Comparison – Sensor Technologies vs Cameras: 
The table below summarizes pros and cons of different counting technologies and their fit for retail environments:

| Technology | Pros | Cons | Accuracy | Privacy | Best For | Example Products |
|------------|------|------|----------|---------|----------|------------------|
| Camera-based | Rich analytics, group differentiation | Needs lighting, higher cost | 95-99% | Moderate (anonymized) | Medium-large stores, malls | FootfallCam, V-Count |
| IR Beam | Simple, low cost, battery-powered | Limited accuracy, no direction | 70-85% | High (no images) | Small shops, single entrances | Storetraffic PEARL |
| Thermal | Works in dark, privacy-friendly | Limited analytics, crowd issues | 90-98% | High (heat only) | Supermarkets, wide entrances | Irisys Vector 4D |
| Radar | Complete privacy, no lighting needed | Newer tech, calibration needed | 90-95% | Very high | Privacy-sensitive venues | Vayyar Retail |
| Wi-Fi | No dedicated hardware, dwell insights | Indirect counting, privacy concerns | 60-80% | Low (device tracking) | Malls, complementing cameras | Cisco Meraki CMX |

## Cloud vs. On-Premise Solutions

Most modern counting systems provide cloud-based services – meaning the devices installed in stores transmit data to cloud servers where analytics dashboards aggregate and display insights. Cloud solutions are convenient: retailers can log into a web portal to see all their locations, compare store traffic, and get updates in real time. For example, both FootfallCam and V-Count offer cloud dashboards where data from all sensors is collected and processed (with options to export reports to Excel, etc.). Cloud systems also handle software updates and maintenance of analytics algorithms automatically.

However, some retailers (or specific use-cases) prefer on-premise systems. On-premise means the counting data stays within the local network – either stored on a local server or the device itself. This can be due to privacy regulations or simply unreliable internet connectivity. Many solutions offer a hybrid: for instance, FootfallCam's devices can store data locally if connection is lost and later upload it, and they have an Enterprise Server option for customers to host the analytics platform privately. Similarly, the Dahua/Hikvision approach typically is on-premise by default (data stays on the NVR), though it lacks the multi-location analysis unless the retailer sets up a central server. CountRite's solution is often on-premise with remote access – they install the system on a client's network and the data can be accessed through a web dashboard that the client hosts. Vayyar's system likely sends data to a cloud service for the advanced processing (given the complexity of radar imaging analytics), but could potentially also be deployed on a local server for real-time alerts within a store.

### Key considerations:

**Data Accessibility**: Cloud systems allow viewing from anywhere and easy comparison across branches. On-premise might limit access to within the company's network or require VPN for remote access.

**Data Security**: Some retailers are sensitive about footfall data or camera feeds leaving the premises. On-prem keeps raw data internal. That said, top cloud providers like V-Count and FootfallCam emphasize that they only transmit anonymous counts or non-identifiable data.

**Reliability**: A cloud system depends on internet uptime. If a store's connection goes down, most counters will store data and sync later (avoiding loss), but real-time monitoring might be lost temporarily. On-prem continues to work locally regardless of internet.

**Maintenance**: Cloud solutions shift the maintenance of the software to the provider (they handle updates, new features, backups). On-prem would require the retailer's IT to maintain the server and software updates. Many Israeli retailers with limited IT staff opt for cloud for this reason.

**Cost**: Some cloud solutions are sold as subscription (SaaS) – e.g., monthly fee per sensor or per store for the analytics platform. Over time this can be costlier than a one-time on-prem software license. Retailers must weigh upfront vs ongoing costs. For example, an on-premise FootfallCam Enterprise might involve buying a license outright, whereas the cloud Basic/Pro has an annual fee after the first year.

## Additional Analytics: Heatmaps, Dwell Time, Demographics

Beyond just counting how many people enter, retailers often want to know what people do inside the store. Many head-counting solutions provide additional analytics either as built-in features or as optional modules:

**Heatmaps**: Visual representations of where people spend time in the store. Usually, heatmap data comes from overhead sensors tracking movement. Solutions like V-Count and RetailNext generate heatmaps by using multiple sensors that cover the store floor and following each visitor's path (anonymously). FootfallCam offers an "In-Store Analytics" setup with their Centroid sensors specifically for this. Heatmaps help identify "hot zones" (popular areas) and dead zones in a shop, informing merchandising and layout decisions. Note: Implementing heatmaps typically requires more hardware (to cover every zone of the floor, not just entrances) and advanced software to stitch the data. It's most feasible for medium to large stores, museums, malls, etc., where understanding internal flows is crucial.

**Dwell Time & Engagement**: This measures how long customers dwell in certain areas or how long they wait. Dwell can be measured by camera (if someone stays in a zone under a sensor) or by Wi-Fi tracking (phone stays in vicinity) or by radar (person remains in area X seconds). Many systems output average dwell time in the store, or time spent in front of a specific display (if sensors are pointed at, say, a promotional endcap). Queue analytics are a specific application – e.g., counting how many people are waiting at checkout and for how long. Providers like V-Count explicitly list queue monitoring and even alert on customer abandonment from queues. This is very useful in supermarkets and banks to optimize service points. Benefit: Dwell metrics indicate engagement; if people spend longer, they may be more interested (or it could mean slow service if it's a queue). Retailers use this to schedule staff (e.g., open another register if queue wait exceeds 5 minutes) and to evaluate if store layout changes keep customers longer. Many of the Israeli providers incorporate dwell/queue: CountRite's system can show where congestion happens and peak times, FootfallCam has a Queue Counting app as well, and Hikvision's people counting camera can be complemented by a separate queue detector camera in their lineup if needed.

**Demographic Insights**: Some camera-based systems attempt to provide demographics like gender and age group of visitors. This is done via AI facial analysis on the camera feed. For instance, V-Count Ultima AI can estimate a visitor's gender and age range with its AI chip. OP Retail (a Chinese provider) also mentions gender/age analytics by using embedded AI. This feature typically requires a camera to get a frontal face view; hence it might be implemented at entrance (as people walk in) or via additional cameras at key zones. In Israel, privacy laws must be considered – while these systems do not store personal data or images, they do analyze biometric features on the fly. Retailers interested in demographics (e.g., mall operators wanting to know the shopper profile for leasing decisions, or a fashion store checking if they attract the target age group) can use these, but they should disclose such analytics in privacy policies. Limitations: The accuracy of age/gender classification can vary (lighting, angles, and diverse appearances affect it). Also, wearing masks (as seen in recent times) or cultural attire can limit face analysis. Still, when working, it gives an approximate breakdown like "60% of today's visitors were male, 40% female, and the largest age segment was 25-34."

**Conversion Rates & Other KPIs**: When people counting data is integrated with sales data (from POS systems), retailers can calculate conversion rate (what percentage of visitors make a purchase). Many solutions allow inputting or integrating sales transactions for this purpose. Ipsos Retail Performance (a service provider under Ipsos) for example emphasizes using count data to drive conversion improvements. RetailNext and FootfallCam also support such integration. Additionally, some platforms incorporate external data like weather (to see impact on footfall) or marketing events (FootfallCam has a marketing ROI app). These higher-level analytics turn raw footfall numbers into actionable business insights, which larger retail operations in Israel are increasingly adopting.

## Suppliers and Service Providers in Israel

Israel's retail tech market has both local companies and local resellers of global products:

**SysCount Ltd**: Local Israeli distributor and service provider for FootfallCam. They handle consultation, installation, and support for FootfallCam systems in Israel. SysCount provides Hebrew-language dashboards and has experience deploying in various formats (from small shops to large malls). They focus on combining people counts with customer preference analysis (likely referring to linking footfall with sales/behavior data).

**CountRite Technologies**: A homegrown Israeli company with over 15 years experience in counting systems. CountRite offers a range of products (people counting, occupancy management, queue management, smart building integration, bicycle and vehicle counters, etc. ). They act both as a product developer and system integrator, giving them flexibility to customize solutions. Israeli retail chains looking for a one-stop solution often engage CountRite for tailored deployments and ongoing support.

**HyperTech and others (V-Count Resellers)**: HyperTech is one Israeli tech integrator offering the V-Count solution (as seen on their Hebrew site). They provide the V-Count hardware and set up the analytics platform for clients, likely also offering first-line support. V-Count also lists a global reseller network, so there may be other Israeli partners or the option to work directly with V-Count's team for large projects.

**iSeeYou Tech**: This is an Israeli company (as evidenced by their Hebrew website) that specializes in integrating CCTV-based analytics. They have deployed Dahua's people counting solutions in a large retail chain locally. iSeeYou likely provides consulting on using the data (e.g., tying footfall to store performance) since their site mentions learning about customer behavior, conversion rates, and optimizing store design using the data. They can be seen as one of the security-focused integrators that expanded into retail analytics.

**Security System Integrators**: Aside from dedicated counting providers, many security companies in Israel now offer people counting as part of their solutions. For example, Protouch, a multimedia and security systems firm, advertises an automatic crowd counting and alert system for malls, shopping centers, airports, etc.. Another, GVision (GVSS), and My Security also list people counting systems in their portfolio. These firms typically implement solutions using hardware from Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, or Xovis, combined with either the manufacturer's software or a third-party analytics platform. They are good contacts for retailers who want to add counting to an existing camera system or get a turnkey installation.

**Global Companies with Israel Presence**: While companies like RetailNext and ShopperTrak (Sensormatic) do not have Israeli subsidiaries, their solutions have been used in Israel via global roll-outs. Ipsos (through its Retail Performance unit) also can service Israeli clients, either remotely or via their EU teams, providing hardware and analytics as a service. During events like the NRF (Retail's Big Show) or local tech expos, Israeli retailers often connect with these global providers.

## Summary

In summary, retailers in Israel have access to a comprehensive range of head-counting solutions – from simple counters suitable for a small boutique, to AI-driven multi-sensor platforms for large malls. Table 1 compared leading products, and Table 2 contrasted the technologies. The choice depends on the retailer's needs and budget:

**Small stores or boutiques**: If budget is tight, a basic IR beam counter or an entry-level stereo counter (like a single FootfallCam or a Hikvision cam) might suffice to get footfall data. This gives an easy metric for conversion rate (sales per visitor). If the store owner wants more insights (like how long customers spend or which sections they visit), a camera-based solution with heatmap capability could be considered, but the cost must be justified.

**Malls and large retail chains**: These typically benefit from robust camera-based networks (FootfallCam, V-Count, RetailNext, CountRite) because they need high accuracy across many entrances and the ability to consolidate data from dozens of sensors. They also often desire advanced analytics – for example, knowing mall occupancy in real time for safety, or comparing traffic across different mall zones to set rent for tenants. The investment in a cloud analytics platform pays off with rich data (reports that can influence marketing, staffing, leasing, etc.). Mall operators in Israel have indeed deployed such systems – for instance, CountRite cites major Israeli mall groups as clients, and SysCount (FootfallCam) likewise targets malls.

**Supermarkets and large format stores**: They focus on occupancy, queue management, and conversion. A combination of overhead counters at entrances (to measure total footfall) and checkout analytics (some use camera or IR at checkout lines) can greatly help manage staffing. V-Count and FootfallCam both have specific solutions for supermarkets (e.g., measuring how many people leave without buying – by comparing entries to transactions – and monitoring queue lengths to open new tills). For these retailers, accuracy and reliability are key (to trust the data for operational decisions), so high-grade stereo counters or thermal counters are popular. Indeed, many supermarkets in Israel use counting systems to comply with occupancy limits and to gather hourly customer traffic for scheduling.

**Retail banking, museums, public venues**: These also use people counters (for occupancy safety and to understand visitor patterns). They often opt for integrated solutions that can tie into building management. For example, a museum might use a people counting system to activate air conditioning in galleries only when occupied (CountRite mentions such smart building control options). In these scenarios, either camera or thermal or radar could be used – if privacy is a concern (e.g., in a bank), a thermal or radar solution provides counts without any video.

**Advanced use-cases**: If a retailer wants to experiment with bleeding-edge tech, the Vayyar radar solution stands out. It could be particularly useful in high-end stores or test labs to see extremely granular behavior (like which product displays are touched or how customers navigate the aisles) without cameras. This could complement camera systems (radar for shelf interaction, cameras for entry count).

Finally, pricing varies widely. For a rough sense, a single-store deployment can range from a few hundred dollars (simple counter) to a few thousand (camera + software). Enterprise solutions for a chain can run tens of thousands of dollars per year when covering multiple stores and advanced analytics subscriptions. It
